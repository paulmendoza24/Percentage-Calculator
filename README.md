A simple Percentage Calculator application by falcon built using Python and Tkinter. This tool helps to calculate percentages in three different modes:

1. **Calculate Percentage of a Value**
2. **Calculate Percentage from Part and Total**
3. **Calculate Percentage Increase/Decrease**
## Features
* Mode 1: Calculate percentage of a given value (e.g., 20% of 150).
* Mode 2: Calculate the percentage of a part relative to the total (e.g., what percentage is 40 out of 200?).
* Mode 3: Calculate the percentage increase or decrease between two values (e.g., increase from 50 to 60, what percentage increase is that?).
* Input validation to ensure correct data types.
* Simple, clean, and intuitive graphical user interface using Tkinter.
## Requirements
* Python 3.x (tested with version 3.12.7)
* Tkinter (comes bundled with Python)
* Icon and background images are required (can be found in the images/ directory).
